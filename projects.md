The Endings Project

Whereas the codex has proven its reliability over centuries, the digital documents in increasingly wide use today are evanescent and fragile. The digital humanities are facing an urgent problem: experts warn of a new “digital dark age” as our ability to produce digital content continues to outpace our capacity to preserve and access on-line resources for the long term. Awareness of the challenge of preserving and future-proofing these digital projects—many based on boutique technologies and customized code—is growing across the DH landscape, but to date more literature has been devoted to identifying the problem than to solving it.

In April 2016, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded for four years Endings: Concluding, Archiving, and Preserving Digital Projects for Long-Term Usability, a project exploring practical answers to the questions of how and where DH projects should be archived in order maintain the dynamic features that make them readable, searchable, and even interactive. Our research is based on four case studies, each one a Digital Humanities project born from print sources.

The deep enrichment afforded to print by digital tools must not be lost in the face of poor (or no) viable preservation strategies. Our goal is to afford the same sort of stability to DH work that print has provided for so long.
